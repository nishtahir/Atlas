### Why yet another text editor? ###

* It was originally a learning project to work with SWT. I thought open sourcing it was a good idea.

### Dependencies ###

* Eclipse SWT
* ANTLR 4.5
* JUnit 4

### Tools ###

* Apache Maven

### Contribution guidelines ###

* All contributions are welcome
* Unit tests are appreciated
* Report bugs using the issue tracker.
* Add feature requests using the issue tracker

#### Testing conventions ####

* _Ideally_ every Foo.java should have a corresponding FooTest.java class
* Methods in FooTest.java should follow the following convention
    
    public void methodToTest_TestCondition_ExpectedResult() { ... }
